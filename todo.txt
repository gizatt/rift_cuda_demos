good source on shaders

simple_particle_swirl:
-add texture to ground, and maybe a mesh or two for scale. (start fleshing out
the game itself now that framework is getting done, essentially)

rift handler:
-distortion pixel shader for rift readiness
-framework for sensor fusion handler, though it'll def. need debugging
when unit arrives

player handler:
-should utilities like body drawing be in the player manager? probably.
Add basic body drawing (from mesh, maybe?).
Add a better looking forward-HUD in there too -- some kind of pretty HUD that
floats in front and responds to body movement, maybe.







vr jam

-high contrast design -- wireframe, dark and light, but not jarring
	makes for asset-light but powerful interface (and gameplay?)

-DIVE-like in terms of screendoor but resolution instead of contrast limited
	(plus moire)

-limit to mouse/keyboard

-want to do head-oriented control / interface, put emphasis on head movement somehow --
	-- head lamp
	-- endermen-like 

-never touch keyboard? never remind user that they're wearing headset -- 
	gamepad, just mouse, no controller but head?
	EVEVR -- headset + gamepad but nothing else in cockpit can feel like joystick
	have to force into VR mindset -- as much restricting input choices as granting
		to make sure they actually try to utilize them
		ex: TF2 regular WASD controls + HMD = just TF2 with nice monitor
			(but headset isn't enough control for some games?)

-never move player position outside of their control (except for emphasis?)

Horror fits bill: limited input, dark and high-contrast (so easy asset wise)
	but gimicky, unless it's really really really high quality

Procedural generation for ze laziness

Some inspirations, limited input + some procedural or dynamic generation:
	audiosurf - 2 button rhythm off of a music track
		(or maybe some kind of merger with rhythm heaven)
		so like greebles but legit interactive
	journey - minimalist naturalistic environment


Head bobbing rave simulator to a target beat track (guitar/dj hero/rhythm heaven)
	- gesture recognition on nodding
	- audio recognition for song, extract beat pattern to perform

Unicorn simulator
	poke EVERYTHING with horn mounted on head
	but no positional tracking yet so it'll feel wrong

"Don't Stare" sort of game
