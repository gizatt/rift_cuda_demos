TODO:

simple_particle_swirl:
-add texture to ground, and maybe a mesh or two for scale. (start fleshing out
the game itself now that framework is getting done, essentially)

rift handler:
-distortion pixel shader for rift readiness
-framework for sensor fusion handler, though it'll def. need debugging
when unit arrives

player handler:
-should utilities like body drawing be in the player manager? probably.
Add basic body drawing (from mesh, maybe?).
Add a better looking forward-HUD in there too -- some kind of pretty HUD that
floats in front and responds to body movement, maybe.
